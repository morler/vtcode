## [Unreleased] - Latest Improvements

### **Major Enhancements - Context Engineering & Attention Management** (Phase 1 & 2)

#### Phase 1: Enhanced System Prompts

- **Explicit Response Framework**: All system prompts now include a clear 5-step framework
  1. Assess the situation - Understand what the user needs
  2. Gather context efficiently - Use search tools before reading files
  3. Make precise changes - Prefer targeted edits over rewrites
  4. Verify outcomes - Test changes appropriately  
  5. Confirm completion - Summarize and verify satisfaction
- **Enhanced Guidelines**: More specific guidance on tool selection, code style preservation, and handling destructive operations
- **Multi-Turn Coherence**: Explicit guidance on building context across conversation turns
- **Token Efficiency**: Maintained concise prompts (~280 tokens) while adding structure

**System Prompt Improvements:**
- Default prompt: Added explicit framework, guidelines, and context management strategies
- Lightweight prompt: Added minimal 4-step approach for quick tasks
- Specialized prompt: Added tool selection strategy by phase, advanced guidelines, and multi-turn coherence

#### Phase 2: Dynamic Context Curation

- **New Module**: `context_curator.rs` - Implements iterative per-turn context selection based on Anthropic's principles
- **Conversation Phase Detection**: Automatically detects phase (Exploration, Implementation, Validation, Debugging, Unknown)
- **Phase-Aware Tool Selection**: Dynamically selects relevant tools based on current conversation phase
- **Priority-Based Context Selection**:
  1. Recent messages (always included, configurable)
  2. Active work context (files being modified)
  3. Decision ledger summary (compact)
  4. Recent errors and resolutions
  5. Relevant tools (phase-aware)
- **Automatic Compression**: Compresses context when budget is exceeded while preserving priority items
- **Configurable Curation**: Full control via `[context.curation]` configuration

**Key Features:**
- Tracks active files and file summaries
- Maintains recent error context for debugging
- Selects optimal tools based on conversation phase
- Respects token budget constraints
- Integrates with TokenBudgetManager and DecisionTracker

**API:**
```rust
let curator = ContextCurator::new(config, token_budget, decision_ledger);
curator.mark_file_active("src/main.rs".to_string());
curator.add_error(ErrorContext { ... });
let curated = curator.curate_context(&messages, &tools).await?;
```

**Configuration:**
```toml
[context.curation]
enabled = true
max_tokens_per_turn = 100000
preserve_recent_messages = 5
max_tool_descriptions = 10
include_ledger = true
ledger_max_entries = 12
include_recent_errors = true
max_recent_errors = 3
```

#### Token Budget Tracking & Attention Management

- **New Module**: `token_budget.rs` - Real-time token budget tracking using `tiktoken-rs`
- **Component-Level Tracking**: Monitor token usage by category (system prompt, messages, tool results, decision ledger)
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Warning at 75% and compaction trigger at 85% (customizable via `vtcode.toml`)
- **Model-Specific Tokenizers**: Support for GPT, Claude, and other models for accurate counting
- **Automatic Deduction**: Track token removal during context cleanup and compaction
- **Budget Reports**: Generate detailed token usage reports by component
- **Performance Optimized**: ~10Î¼s per message using Rust-native `tiktoken-rs`
- **New Method**: `remaining_tokens()` - Get remaining tokens in budget for context curation decisions

**Configuration:**
```toml
[context.token_budget]
enabled = true
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
warning_threshold = 0.75
compaction_threshold = 0.85
detailed_tracking = false
```
