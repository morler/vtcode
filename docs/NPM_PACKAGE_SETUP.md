# VT Code npm Package Setup - Summary

## What has been completed:

1. Created the npm directory structure with all required files:
   - package.json with proper metadata
   - index.js entry point
   - bin/vtcode executable wrapper
   - scripts/postinstall.js (downloads platform-specific binary)
   - scripts/preuninstall.js (cleans up binaries)

2. Updated README.md to include npm installation instructions

3. Verified the package structure with `npm pack`

## What needs to be done next:

1. **Release v0.13.0**: 
   - The npm package is configured for v0.13.0, but the GitHub release doesn't exist yet
   - Run the release script: `./scripts/release.sh --patch` (or --minor/--major as appropriate)

2. **Upload binaries to GitHub Release**:
   - After creating the release, the postinstall script will be able to download the binaries
   - The release needs to include binaries for all supported platforms:
     - macOS ARM64 (aarch64-apple-darwin)
     - macOS x64 (x86_64-apple-darwin)
     - Linux ARM64 (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)
     - Linux x64 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
     - Windows x64 (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)

3. **Publish to npm**:
   - Once the release is created and binaries are available, run:
     ```bash
     cd npm
     npm publish
     ```

## Testing the package:

1. After the release is created, you can test the package installation:
   ```bash
   cd test-npm
   npm install
   npx vtcode --help
   ```

2. Or install globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @vinhnx/vtcode
   vtcode --help
   ```

## Package features:

- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Automatic binary download for the correct platform during installation
- Cleanup on uninstall
- Proper metadata and documentation
