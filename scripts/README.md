# Development Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help with development, testing, and maintaining the vtcode codebase.

## Available Scripts

### `setup.sh` - Development Environment Setup

Sets up the complete development environment with all necessary tools.

```bash
# Basic setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# Setup with git hooks
./scripts/setup.sh --with-hooks

# Show help
./scripts/setup.sh --help
```

**What it does:**

-   Checks Rust installation
-   Updates Rust toolchain
-   Installs rustfmt and clippy components
-   Installs development tools (cargo-audit, cargo-outdated, etc.)
-   Optionally sets up git hooks
-   Verifies everything works

### `check.sh` - Code Quality Checks

Runs comprehensive code quality checks (same as CI pipeline).

```bash
# Run all checks
./scripts/check.sh

# Run specific checks
./scripts/check.sh fmt      # Format check only
./scripts/check.sh clippy   # Clippy check only
./scripts/check.sh test     # Tests only
./scripts/check.sh build    # Build only
./scripts/check.sh docs     # Documentation only

# Show help
./scripts/check.sh help
```

**Checks performed:**

-   Code formatting (rustfmt)
-   Linting (clippy)
-   Build verification
-   Test execution
-   Documentation generation

### `release.sh` - Release Management

Creates multi-crate releases for VT Code using [`cargo-release`](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release).

```bash
# Create a specific version release
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0

# Create patch release (increment patch version)
./scripts/release.sh --patch

# Create minor release (increment minor version)
./scripts/release.sh --minor

# Create major release (increment major version)
./scripts/release.sh --major

# Dry run to see what would happen
./scripts/release.sh --patch --dry-run

# Show help
./scripts/release.sh --help
```

**What it does:**

-   Delegates version management, tagging, pushing, and changelog updates to `cargo release`
-   Keeps `vtcode` and `vtcode-core` versions in sync and updates `npm/package.json`
-   Creates GitHub releases populated with the relevant changelog section
-   Publishes crates to crates.io (unless `--skip-crates` is provided)
-   Optionally publishes to npm and builds Homebrew binaries

**Prerequisites:**

-   Must be on `main` branch with a clean working tree
-   Requires GitHub repository access and `cargo-release` installed (`cargo install cargo-release`)
-   `CHANGELOG.md` entries follow the expected format (Unreleased + sections)
-   Logged in to crates.io (`cargo login`) and npm (`npm login`) when publishing

**Release Process:**

1. **Pre-flight checks**: Verifies branch, working tree, and authentication
2. **cargo-release execution**: Runs `cargo release` with workspace configuration from `release.toml`
3. **Git operations**: `cargo release` commits, tags, pushes, and updates `CHANGELOG.md`
4. **Distribution**: Publishes crates, optionally publishes npm package, triggers docs.rs rebuild, and builds binaries
5. **GitHub Release**: `cargo release` uploads release notes using the generated changelog section

**Recent Updates:**

-   Fixed changelogithub CLI compatibility issues by switching to the official GitHub Action
-   Added proper workflow permissions for release creation
-   Improved error handling and debugging information

## Quick Start

For new developers:

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd vtcode
    ```

2. **Set up development environment**

    ```bash
    ./scripts/setup.sh --with-hooks
    ```

3. **Configure API keys (optional)**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root to store your API keys:

    ```bash
    # .env file
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

4. **Run code quality checks**

    ```bash
    ./scripts/check.sh
    ```

5. **Start developing!**

    ```bash
    cargo build
    cargo nextest run
    ```

## API Key Configuration

vtcode supports multiple ways to configure API keys, with the following priority:

1. **Environment variables** (highest priority) - Most secure
2. **.env file** - Convenient for development
3. **Configuration file** (vtcode.toml) - Least secure, but convenient

Example `.env` file:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Example `vtcode.toml` configuration:

```toml
[agent]
gemini_api_key = "your_gemini_api_key_here"
anthropic_api_key = "your_anthropic_api_key_here"
openai_api_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These scripts run the same checks as our GitHub Actions workflows:

-   `ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
-   `code-quality.yml` - Code quality checks
-   `development.yml` - Development workflow
-   `nightly.yml` - Nightly builds

## Pre-commit Hooks

When you run `./scripts/setup.sh --with-hooks`, a pre-commit hook is created that will:

1. Check code formatting with rustfmt
2. Run clippy linting
3. Prevent commits if issues are found

The hook can be bypassed with `git commit --no-verify` if needed.

## Customization

You can modify these scripts to fit your development workflow:

-   Add additional tools to `setup.sh`
-   Modify check criteria in `check.sh`
-   Customize git hooks for your team

## Troubleshooting

### Script permissions

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Rust not found

Make sure Rust is installed:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
```

### Tools installation fails

Some tools might require additional dependencies:

```bash
# For cargo-tarpaulin (code coverage)
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config

# For cargo-udeps (unused dependencies)
rustup install nightly
```
