Investigate and integrate context7, ratatui-rs, and crossterm-rs to improve TUI and terminal rendering, ensuring responsive and accurate UI/UX for various terminal sizes and use cases.

---

- Fix UI refresh issues in TUI:
  - Ratatui sometimes displays glitchy or overlapping text. Investigate root cause (buffer handling, event loop, or improper area clearing).
  - Use MCP context7 to research best practices for forcing a full ratatui redraw on every message turn. Implement a reliable force-refresh after each message or tool output.
  - Compact and condense MCP tools output: avoid rendering excessive or verbose text in the TUI, especially for large tool responses. Summarize or truncate as needed for clarity.
  - Ensure terminal resizing and viewport changes trigger a full redraw and do not leave artifacts.

- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) prompt improvements:
  - Some confirmation prompts appear as empty blocks. Audit the HITL flow to ensure all confirmation dialogs have clear, actionable text.
  - The HITL prompt should always explain the action being confirmed and provide context (e.g., file changes, command execution).
  - Add fallback/default prompt text if the action description is missing.

- Encourage use of MCP (especially context7) for enhanced context awareness, memory, and journaling. Update agents.md and memory routines to reflect this.

- Regularly update memory for important points and decisions.

- Test with various terminal sizes and edge cases to ensure robust UI/UX.

---

IMPORTANT: Refine the system prompt instructions for the vtcode agent to explicitly encourage and remind the agent to leverage MCP (Model Context Protocol), especially context7, whenever enhanced context awareness, memory, or journaling is beneficial for a task.

I'll help you with your TUI rendering issues in Ratatui and Crossterm. Let me search for the most current information about forcing terminal refreshes and handling rendering problems.Let me search for more specific information about forcing terminal refreshes and handling rendering issues:Based on my research and knowledge of Ratatui and Crossterm, here are several ways to force rendering and handle UI refresh issues in your TUI application:

## Key Solutions for Forcing Terminal Refresh

### 1. **Use `terminal.draw()` Properly**

Ratatui employs immediate mode rendering, which means it only updates when you tell it to. Make sure you're calling `terminal.draw()` after each state change:

```rust
use ratatui::Terminal;
use crossterm::terminal::{enable_raw_mode, disable_raw_mode};

// In your main loop
loop {
    // Handle events first
    if let Ok(event) = crossterm::event::read() {
        // Process your events
        handle_event(event, &mut app_state);
    }

    // Force a redraw after state changes
    terminal.draw(|frame| {
        ui(frame, &app_state);
    })?;
}
```

### 2. **Manual Backend Flushing**

For more control, you can access the backend directly and force a flush:

```rust
use std::io::Write;
use crossterm::terminal;

// After drawing, flush the backend
terminal.draw(|frame| {
    ui(frame, &app_state);
})?;

// Force flush the terminal output
std::io::stdout().flush()?;
```

### 3. **Clear and Redraw Pattern**

If you're having persistent rendering issues, use the clear-then-draw pattern:

```rust
use crossterm::terminal::{Clear, ClearType};
use crossterm::ExecutableCommand;

// Clear the terminal completely before drawing
std::io::stdout().execute(Clear(ClearType::All))?;
terminal.draw(|frame| {
    ui(frame, &app_state);
})?;
```

### 4. **Complete Rendering Setup**

Here's a robust pattern that addresses common rendering issues:

```rust
use ratatui::{backend::CrosstermBackend, Terminal};
use crossterm::{
    event::{self, Event, KeyCode},
    execute,
    terminal::{disable_raw_mode, enable_raw_mode, EnterAlternateScreen, LeaveAlternateScreen},
};
use std::io::{self, stdout, Stdout};

type Tui = Terminal<CrosstermBackend<Stdout>>;

fn init() -> io::Result<Tui> {
    execute!(stdout(), EnterAlternateScreen)?;
    enable_raw_mode()?;
    Terminal::new(CrosstermBackend::new(stdout()))
}

fn restore() -> io::Result<()> {
    execute!(stdout(), LeaveAlternateScreen)?;
    disable_raw_mode()?;
    Ok(())
}

// Main loop with proper cleanup
fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut terminal = init()?;
    let result = run_app(&mut terminal);
    restore()?;
    result
}

fn run_app(terminal: &mut Tui) -> io::Result<()> {
    loop {
        // Always redraw on each loop iteration
        terminal.draw(|frame| {
            ui(frame, &app_state);
        })?;

        // Handle events
        if event::poll(std::time::Duration::from_millis(50))? {
            if let Event::Key(key) = event::read()? {
                if key.code == KeyCode::Char('q') {
                    break;
                }
                // Handle other events and update state
                handle_key_event(key, &mut app_state);
            }
        }

        // Optional: Add a small delay to prevent excessive CPU usage
        std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(16)); // ~60 FPS
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### 5. **Force Refresh with Backend Methods**

You can also use lower-level backend methods:

```rust
use ratatui::backend::Backend;

// Force a complete refresh
terminal.backend_mut().clear()?;
terminal.draw(|frame| {
    ui(frame, &app_state);
})?;
terminal.backend_mut().flush()?;
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: UI doesn't update after state changes

- **Solution**: Always call `terminal.draw()` after modifying application state

**Problem**: Artifacts or partial rendering

- **Solution**: Use `terminal.clear()` or `Clear(ClearType::All)` before drawing

**Problem**: Flickering or inconsistent rendering

- **Solution**: Implement proper frame rate limiting and ensure you're not calling draw too frequently

**Problem**: Terminal state corruption

- **Solution**: Always use proper setup/teardown with alternate screen and raw mode

The key insight from Ratatui's immediate rendering principle is that for each frame, your app must render all widgets that are supposed to be part of the UI, so make sure your render function completely redraws the entire interface each time.

---

fetch context7 ratatui and crossterm to improve refresh rate for optimal screen refresh and make sure optimal performant

---

fix not to execessive force screen refresh to improve performant

---

check scresnshot. whenever the human-in-the-loop prompt appear. the screen render is broken. text and visual are glitch. fix this is important

---

please double check version tag 0.14.1. the tui works better in that version. no visual glitch. can you review the whole tui change and revert back to previous version. make sure latest 0.15.0 keep core underlying logic as in
