## Understanding Context Engineering

### The Fundamental Difference

**Prompt Engineering (Single-Turn):**

```
System Prompt + User Message → [Model] → Response
```

- Static, one-time optimization
- Focus on crafting the perfect prompt
- Limited to single interaction

**Context Engineering (Multi-Turn Agents):**

```
Available Context → [Curation] → Selected Context → [Model] → Response → Tool Results
                                        ↑                                      ↓
                                        └─────── Iterate each turn ────────────┘
```

- Dynamic, iterative optimization
- Focus on **what** to include each turn
- Continuous across entire conversation

**Key Insight:** Context engineering is about **curation** - selecting the right context for each turn, not just crafting a good initial prompt.

## System Prompt Calibration: The "Just Right" Approach

### Spectrum of Prompt Quality

#### ❌ Too Specific (Brittle)

```
You MUST FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
1. Identify intent as one of [A, B, C]
2. If A, ask 3 questions, then call tool_x
   - If in country Y, do step Z
   - If user mentions W, follow these 9 sub-steps...
3. Here are 47 edge cases...
```

**Problems:**

- Hardcoded if-else logic
- Overly prescriptive
- Fails on unexpected inputs
- Difficult to maintain

#### ✅ Just Right (VTCode's Approach)

```
You are VT Code, a coding agent.

**Core Responsibilities:**
Explore code, make precise changes, validate outcomes.

**Response Framework:**
1. Assess the situation
2. Gather context efficiently
3. Make precise changes
4. Verify outcomes
5. Confirm completion

**Guidelines:**
- Search before reading
- Preserve existing patterns
- Explain destructive operations
```

**Characteristics:**

- Clear role and responsibilities
- Response framework (not rigid steps)
- Guidelines that help model decide
- Flexible enough to adapt

#### ❌ Too Vague

```
You are a coding assistant.
Try to solve coding issues.
Escalate if needed.
```

**Problems:**

- Assumes shared context
- Lacks concrete guidance
- Inconsistent behavior
- Requires many clarifications

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Strengths ✅

1. **Token Efficiency**
   - Dramatic reduction in upfront token costs
   - More room for actual conversation and code
   - Faster responses due to less processing

   - Recommended: Explicit 5-step framework
   - Benefit: More consistent approach across tasks

2. **Context Curation Strategy**
   - Current: Static system prompt + message history
   - Recommended: Dynamic per-turn curation
   - Benefit: Better token usage, more relevant context

   - Benefit: Fewer tool re-executions, better continuity

4. **Tool Selection Guidance**
   - Current: Tool descriptions
   - Recommended: Phase-aware descriptions
   - Benefit: Context-appropriate tool usage

## Improved System Prompts

### Default Prompt Enhancement

**Current (200 tokens):**

- Clear and concise
- Good context strategy
- Basic behavior guidance

**Improved (280 tokens):**

- Explicit 5-step response framework
- More specific guidelines
- Better multi-turn coherence guidance
- Situation-specific advice

**Trade-off:** +80 tokens (~0.06% of 128k context)
**Benefit:** More consistent behavior, fewer clarifications

### Key Improvements

1. **Response Framework:**

   ```
   1. Assess the situation
   2. Gather context efficiently
   3. Make precise changes
   4. Verify outcomes
   5. Confirm completion
   ```

2. **Enhanced Guidelines:**

   ```
   - When multiple approaches exist, choose simplest
   - If file mentioned, search first for context
   - Preserve existing code style and patterns
   - For destructive ops, explain impact first
   - Acknowledge urgency and respond clearly
   ```

3. **Context Management:**

   ```
   - Start with lightweight searches
   - Load metadata as references
   - Summarize verbose outputs
   - Track recent actions and decisions
   - When approaching limits, summarize completed work
   ```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced System Prompts (Immediate)

**Goal:** Improve consistency and clarity
**Effort:** Low (update prompt files)
**Impact:** Medium (better guidance, fewer mistakes)

**Actions:**

1. Update `vtcode-core/src/prompts/system.rs`
2. Add explicit response framework
3. Enhance guidelines section
4. Add multi-turn coherence guidance

**Testing:**

- A/B test current vs improved prompts
- Measure task success rate
- Track clarification rounds needed

### Phase 2: Dynamic Context Curation (Short-term)

**Goal:** Select optimal context each turn
**Effort:** Medium (new module)
**Impact:** High (better token usage)

**Actions:**

1. Create `ContextCurator` module
2. Implement per-turn context selection
3. Integrate with `TokenBudgetManager`
4. Add configuration options

**Features:**

```rust
pub struct ContextCurator {
    fn curate_context(&mut self,
        conversation: &[Message],
        available_tools: &[Tool],
    ) -> CuratedContext {
        // Priority 1: Recent messages (always)
        // Priority 2: Active work context
        // Priority 3: Decision ledger (compact)
        // Priority 4: Recent errors
        // Priority 5: Relevant tools only
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Adaptive Tool Descriptions (Medium-term)

**Goal:** Context-aware tool guidance
**Effort:** Medium (phase detection + logic)
**Impact:** Medium (better tool selection)

**Actions:**

1. Detect conversation phase (Exploration, Implementation, Validation)
2. Adjust tool descriptions based on phase
3. Provide phase-specific guidance

**Example:**

```rust
Phase::Exploration => "grep_search: Use this to find relevant code before reading files"
Phase::Implementation => "edit_file: Make precise changes; preferred over write_file"
Phase::Validation => "run_terminal_cmd: Validate changes with tests"
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Multi-Turn Coherence (Long-term)

**Goal:** Better context building across turns
**Effort:** High (requires learning system)
**Impact:** High (fewer re-executions)

**Actions:**

1. Track file examination history
2. Reference past results by summary
3. Build codebase mental model
4. Learn from error patterns
