The permissions system

Again, the team has opted for simplicity and built a permissions system that seeks permission before executing an action. The user can then decide to:

    Grant the permission once

    Grant the permission for future sessions, as well

    Reject the permission

-> for rm command, seeking permission before deleting a file
